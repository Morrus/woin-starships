<h2>Starship Hull Class</h2>
<p class="explainer">

    Starships are categorized by class, which is a rough measure of tonnage. This initial decision determines the size
    parameters of your ship design. It also determines your crew requirement, fuel capacity, cargo space, and DEFENSE
    values.

<h3>Hull Configuration</h3>
<p class="explainer">
    Also select an (optional) hull configuration. There are as many different vessel types as there are stars in the
    sky. The following list is a summary of some common classifications listed in approximate typical size order. Each
    configuration grants the ship one exploit.
</p>
<select style='overflow:hidden;max-width:500px;' ng-model="ship.hullConfig"
        ng-options="config.display for config in hullConfigurations">

</select>

<h3>Troops & Passengers</h3>
<p class="explainer">
    In addition to the crew, a ship can carry troops (military personnel of various kinds). Troops add to the crew
    complement for the purposes of calculating LUXURY (see below), and each uses 2 CU of cargo space.

    Passenger capacity also uses cargo space. Standard passengers use 2 CU each, while Luxury passengers use 4 Cu. As
    with troops, passengers add to the crew complement for the purposes of calculating LUXURY</p>
